Data hiding is a technique of hiding internal object details, i.e., data members. It is an object-oriented programming technique. 
Data hiding ensures, or we can say guarantees to restrict the data access to class members.
It maintains data integrity.
Data hiding means hiding the internal data within the class to prevent its direct access from outside the class.
